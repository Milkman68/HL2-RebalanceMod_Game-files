This is the compatibility patch for mounting this mod onto HL2 Mirrored. 
!DO NOT! put this by itself in the sourcemod directory like a regular mod. Things WILL break if you do that. 
Hl2 Mirrored is required to be installed before installing this.

Read the installation instructions carefully for more information:

After installing HL2 Mirrored, Extract all the contents of the hl2_rebalance folder into the hl2_mirrored folder in your sourcemod directory.

If asked, allow it to override all files.

From there restart steam, start up the game, and you're ready to play!

If at any point you wish to uninstall it, delete the hl2_mirrored folder in the sourcemod folder. From there restart steam and the mod should be gone.
