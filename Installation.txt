Extract this mod's hl2 folder in your Half-life 2 directory in Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2

When it asks if you want to replace files, agree to replace all of them.

From there start up the game and you're ready to play.

If at any point you wish to unistall it, right click Half-Life 2 in the game list, on the dropdown menu click "Properties...".
From there click on "LOCAL FILES" then simply click "Verify integrity of game files...". 
Then it should automatically start removing changed files, disregarding the custom folder.

If changes are still visible after verifying the files, unistall and reinstall Half-Life 2.
