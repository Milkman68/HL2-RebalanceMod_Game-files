# HL2 Rebalanced
The repository for downloading the mod.
The Sourcecode can be found [here](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod).

## ============Description:============
HL2R is a mod that changes the gameplay and balance of Half-Life 2. Featuring: 

- Revamped Gunplay.
- Revamped balance.
- Harder AI/NPC's.
- Small additions and Bug fixes.
- Visual effects.
- Grenade Cooking.
- Options menu with 7 optional challenges.
- Episode 2 style flashlight (optional).
- New more configurable skill.cfg files.
- ~~S.L.A.M.~~
  

This mod is not intended to radically change HL2's gameplay, but to improve and enhance it wherever possible. With the ultimate goal of replicating the simple challenging but fair gameplay of HL1 (which HL2 was very much lacking in my opinion). 

It aims to make enemies actual threats that should be respected, give all weapons in the player's arsenal use throughout the whole game instead of some becoming completely obsolete, and make the player put more than surface-level amounts of effort and strategy into making it through the default campaign.

## ============Installation:============

To install the mod, click on the green button on the top right corner that says ***Code*** then click ***Download Zip***  
Once the zip is done downloading, open it and extract the mod's hl2_rebalance folder into your sourcemods directory in ***Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/***

From there restart Steam and the mod should appear in your library.

If at any point you wish to uninstall it delete the hl2_rebalance folder, restart Steam and the mod should be gone.

## ============UPDATES:============
- As of January 21st 2023, HL2-Rebalanced now has full [Half-Life 2 Mirrored](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-2-mirrored) support! 
New binarys were compiled using code from the [HL2-Mirrored Repository](https://github.com/NvC-DmN-CH/Half-Life-2-Mirrored), meaning that HL2R's changes won't conflict with HL2-Mirrored's!                               
The mirrored branch can be accessed by clicking on the "main" icon to the left of the "Code" button. Or if you don't feel like doing that here's a link to it [directly.](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod_Game-files/tree/Mirrored) From there just download the mod and follow the installation instructions.
