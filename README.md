The repository for downloading the mod.
The Sourcecode can be found [here](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod).

## ============Description:============
HL2R is a mod that changes the gameplay and balance of Half-Life 2. Featuring: 

- Revamped Gunplay.
- Smarter and more varied enemies.
- Various small additions and Bug fixes.
- Visual effects and dynamic lights.
- Grenade Cooking and other QOL additions.
- New challenges menu with 7 original challenges.
- Episode 2 style flashlight and other toggleable features.
- A more modular skill.cfg system.
- Separate version with [Half-Life 2 Mirrored](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-2-mirrored) merged into HL2R. Allowing for full compatibility with eachother.
- ~~S.L.A.M.~~
  

This mod is not intended to radically change HL2's gameplay, but to improve and enhance it wherever possible. With the ultimate goal of replicating the simple challenging but fair gameplay of HL1, which HL2 was very much lacking in my opinion. 

It aims to make enemies actual threats that should be respected, give all weapons in the player's arsenal use throughout the whole game instead of some becoming completely obsolete, and force the player put more than surface-level amounts of effort and strategy into making it through the default campaign.

## ============Installation:============

To install the mod, click on the green button on the top right corner that says ***Code*** then click ***Download Zip***  
Once the zip is done downloading, open it and extract the mod's hl2_rebalance folder into your sourcemods directory in ***Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/***

From there restart Steam and the mod should appear in your library.

### Mirrored version:
The HL2 Mirrored patch for HL2R can be accessed by clicking on the ***main*** icon on the top-left of the page and switching to the ***Mirrored*** branch. Or if you don't feel like doing that here's a link to it [directly](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod_Game-files/tree/Mirrored). From there just download the Mirrored version and follow the standard installation instructions.
