#### ============Summary:============


This is the feature summary/description for HL2 Rebalanced. A mod I've made with the ultimate goal of improving HL2's core gameplay to provide a more challenging and fun experience. ~~FYI, This summary is just for listing the mods most important features, not necessarily showcasing what the whole mod has to offer. Which is ***way*** more than just this list.~~ Things that've been changed include(but are not limited to):

- Revised Weapon Balance:
Most weapons in the player's arsenal have received changes. Either adjusted to not be direct upgrades of others, or have been given more utility to discourage them from becoming obsolete.  
EG: The Crossbow now needs to be charged over time to deal maximum damage, and the Pistol was buffed to now have Burst-Fire capability.

- Revamped enemy AI: Soldiers and Metrocops in particular have received huge changes to their combat AI to make them more interesting to fight. The way they take cover has been overhauled to encourage better positioning. And their charging behavior has been completely removed so that they don't kill themselves by running directly into the player.

- Changed NPC behavior:
NPCs have also been given more baseline abilities/behaviors. The Strider for example; can now use its Warp Cannon outside of scripted sequences and actually use it on its enemies. Making it much more terrifying to fight than before.

- Visual Changes: Effort has also been put into making things look a little nicer. Dynamic lights have been added to some visual effects like explosions and fire. And Standard Zombies now have more visual diversity, as they have been given 5 additional skins that are randomized into existing zombies. 

Credits for the new skins go out to these mods in particular:
[Alfa33's Zombie Citizen Outfit](https://gamebanana.com/mods/182304)
[Sabre-aN's Headcrab-Zombie Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=206166550)

- Misc Changes: Some miscellaneous things have been added for QOL, to smoothen out the existing experience. Some examples include; the Quickinfo crosshair ammo counter now supporting single-fire weapons, the max FOV being raised to 120, and it's now possible to shoot while zooming.

- Customizability: Effort has been made to add tons of ConVars to the skill.cfg file. And the .cfg system in HL2 has been changed to have more modularity, a new system where each difficulty now has a dedicated .cfg file.

#### ============UPDATES:============
- As of January 21st 2023, HL2-Rebalanced now has full [Half-Life 2 Mirrored](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-2-mirrored) support! 
New binarys were compiled using code from the [HL2-Mirrored Repository](https://github.com/NvC-DmN-CH/Half-Life-2-Mirrored), meaning that HL2R's changes won't conflict with HL2-Mirrored's!                               
The mirrored branch can be accessed by clicking on the "main" icon to the left of the "Code" button. Or if you don't feel like doing that here's a link to it [directly.](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod_Game-files/tree/Mirrored) From there just download the mod and follow the installation instructions.
