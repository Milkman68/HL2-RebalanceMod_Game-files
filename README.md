#### ============Summary:============


This is the (admittedly rudimentary) feature summary for HL2 Rebalanced. A mod I've made with the ultimate goal of improving HL2's core gameplay to provide a more challenging and fun experience. ~~FYI, This summary is basically just for listing the mods most important features, not necessarily showcasing what the whole mod has to offer. Which is ***way*** more than just this list.~~ Things that've been changed include (but are not limited to):

- Revised Weapon Balance:
Most weapons in the player's arsenal have received changes either to not be direct upgrades of others, or have been given more reason to use to prevent them becoming partially obsolete.  
EG: The Crossbow now needs to hit headshots to insta-kill, and the Pistol now has Burst-Fire capability.

- Revamped enemy AI: Soldiers and Metrocops in particular have received massive changes to their combat AI to make them less brainless and more interesting to fight. Including a new Elite variant of the standard Metrocop that specializes in deploying Manhacks.

- Changed NPC behavior:
While smarter AI is nice, giving NPCs more actual things to do makes things much more interesting. The Strider for example; now has the ability to use that giant Warp-Cannon on its enemies. Making it much more terrifying and dynamic than before.

- Visual Changes: Some effort has also been put into making things look a little nicer. There's now colored Muzzleflashes, and Dynamic lights have been added to some visual effects like explosions and fire. Standard Zombies also now have 5 additional skins.  


Credits to the new skins especially go out to these people for making them.

- Misc Changes: Some miscellaneous things have been added to smoothen out the existing experience. For example; the Quickinfo crosshair now supports single-fire weapons, the max FOV has been raised to 120, and it's now possible to shoot while zooming.

- Customizability: Effort has been made to add way more ConVars to the skill.cfg file, (Values in skill.cfg that can be customized). And the .cfg system in HL2 has been changed to have more modularity, including a new system where each difficulty now has a separate skill.cfg file.

#### ============UPDATES:============
- As of January 21st 2023, HL2-Rebalanced now has full [Half-Life 2 Mirrored](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-2-mirrored) support! 
New binarys were compiled using code from the [HL2-Mirrored Repository](https://github.com/NvC-DmN-CH/Half-Life-2-Mirrored), meaning that HL2R's changes won't conflict with HL2-Mirrored's!                               
The mirrored branch can be accessed by clicking on the "main" icon to the left of the "Code" button. Or if you don't feel like doing that here's a link to it [directly](https://github.com/mariovct/HL2-RebalanceMod_Game-files/tree/Mirrored), from there just download the mod and follow the installation instructions.
